# STL Room Layouts

This folder contains STL files for different room layouts that can be displayed in the 3D viewer.

## How to add STL files:

1. Place your `.stl` files in this directory
2. Update the `stlFiles` array in `src/App.js` to include your new files
3. The files will automatically appear in the STL file list

## File naming convention:
- Use descriptive names like `room_layout_1.stl`, `modern_kitchen.stl`, etc.
- Include a description in the App.js file for each STL file

## Example STL files:
- room_layout_1.stl - Modern Open Plan
- room_layout_2.stl - Traditional Layout  
- room_layout_3.stl - Minimalist Design
- room_layout_4.stl - Luxury Suite
- room_layout_5.stl - Studio Apartment
